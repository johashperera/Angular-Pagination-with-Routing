# Angular Pagination with Routing - Proof of Concept

## Introduction

This project serves as a proof of concept to combine pagination with Angular routing. As Angular is a Single Page Application (SPA), the standard approach to pagination can be challenging to implement. However, with this workaround, we can achieve pagination functionality within the context of Angular routing.

## Pagination Implementation

In this project, we've implemented a custom pagination component that allows us to paginate through data fetched from an API or stored locally. The pagination component handles the logic for dividing the data into pages and displaying the appropriate page based on the user's selection.
